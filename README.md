# Library-Management-Python
Code written in pyhton in order to manage a library system.

Note: The code is written in Spanish, but is easy to understand for English speakers.
Note: Each object has some predefined information declared at the very beginning of the Main part of the code, which can be easily deleted if necessary.
Note: The code might not be fully optimized.

This project is programmed in order to control all the elements of a real library system, mentioned below:
1. Biblioteca (Library it self)
2. Libro (Book)
3. Bibliotecario (Librarian)
4. Usuario (Users of the library)
5. Prestamo (Loans of books to users)

Each of the elements mentioned before are objects, and the Main branch is relating each of them.

Done by Roberto Mindrila.
